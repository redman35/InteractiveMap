*Paper with Electronic Inclusions*
Our project aimed to create a cool adventure using two interactive maps: one showing where the treasure island is, and the other showing exactly where the treasure is hidden. To achieve this, we integrated electronic inclusions into our paper, like LEDs for visual cues and wire coils to emit audio instructions. Each map was designed to provide guidance, with recorded instructions tailored to lead users through their exploration. The wire speakers made it feel like the maps were talking to you, making the adventure more immersive, and the LEDs served as dynamic indicators, guiding adventurers along their journey to uncover the hidden treasure.
